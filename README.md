# PS3loadX

PS3loadX is the evolution of [PSL1GHT](https://github.com/ps3dev/PSL1GHT/) PS3load sample, now using the [Tiny3D](https://github.com/wargio/tiny3D/) library. I hope this version helps you to work easily ;)

## Features
- You can load SELF files using the net.
- You can load applications from USB/ HDD devices
- You can install applications to the USB or HDD devices from one .zip file
- You can copy applications from USB devices to HDD
- Also you can delete installed applications.

NOTE:
-----

You can include these lines in your app to return to the PS3LoadX application
```c
#include <sys/process.h>
.....
sysProcessExitSpawn2("/dev_hdd0/game/PSL145310/RELOAD.SELF", NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 1001, SYS_PROCESS_SPAWN_STACK_SIZE_1M);
```

ZIP Format
----------

```
app_folder
|
|---- EBOOT.BIN
|
|---- ICON0.PNG
|
|---- title.txt
```

`app_folder`: folder to install the app
 - in USB devices `/dev_usb000/homebrew/app_folder`
 - from HDD: `/dev_hdd0/game/PSL145310/homebrew/app_folder`

`EBOOT.BIN`: SELF file

`ICON0.PNG`: optional app. image

`title.txt`: it countain one text line with the name app name. If it doesn't exists PS3LoadX uses `app_folder` as title. i.e: "My application - test 1"

Sending SELF files from the net
-------------------------------

You need to send the `.self` from the PC using `psloadx.exe` (see PSL1GHT tools)

For example from one .bat file under Windows:
```
set PS3LOAD = tcp:192.168.2.12 // -> PS3 IP

ps3load.exe *.self

pause
```

Installing ZIP files
--------------------

HDD0 is selected by default. To change to USB you need plug one device.

When you send a ZIP file the app ask to you if you want really install it or not in the current device.
